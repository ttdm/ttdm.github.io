I care deeply about equality.
This is a value I defend with conviction because I believe it’s the foundation of a strong society, something that stands apart from the randomness of nature. Nature distributes opportunities unevenly, but promoting equality helps us level the playing field and give everyone a fair chance to thrive.
I also believe equality is essential for a peaceful society. When inequality is too great, it leads to problems like violence, crime, and poverty. By working toward more fairness, we can ease these issues and create a better environment for everyone.">

<p>I care deeply about equality.</p>
<p>This is a value I defend with conviction because I believe it’s the foundation of a strong society, something that stands apart from the randomness of nature. Nature distributes opportunities unevenly, but promoting equality helps us level the playing field and give everyone a fair chance to thrive.</p>
<p>I also believe equality is essential for a peaceful society. When inequality is too great, it leads to problems like violence, crime, and poverty. By working toward more fairness, we can ease these issues and create a better environment for everyone.</p>
<p>Finally, I see equality as a way to strengthen freedom. In a fairer world, people could choose careers without worrying about financial insecurity or societal judgment. This would allow us to follow paths that truly inspire us, rather than being limited by economic pressures.</p>
<p>These beliefs have led me to take action through a variety of projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>I redeveloped a piano learning software that was originally paid to make it free and accessible to all.</li>
<li>I co-founded and currently lead an association that helps people who are disconnected from the healthcare system access their rights.</li>
<li>I created a digital service tailored for small municipalities often unfamiliar with technology.</li>
<li>More recently, with Alison Jorre, I launched a cooperative called Murmures. It pools earnings from high-paying professions and undervalued ones. Everyone in the cooperative earns the same salary, works under the same conditions, and has an equal say in decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these efforts, I try to show—practically and realistically—that a fairer world isn’t just possible but also worthwhile. I hope Murmures can, over time, become further proof of how beneficial greater equality can be.</p>

<p>I am aphantasic, which means I have no mental imagery. When I close my eyes, I see black; I can’t replay songs in my head or relive tastes or smells. This might seem surprising, but it has no visible impact on my daily life. To me, it’s a great example of the invisible traits that make each of us unique.
Like many aphantasics, I’ve compensated for this trait with strong analytical and organizational skills. These strengths have drawn me toward activities like solving puzzles, competitive programming, poker, and strategy games like Go or chess.</p>

<p>My analytical and logical abilities are also a big part of my career as a developer. I love breaking down complex problems and turning them into simple, effective solutions. My experience includes both traditional software development and projects that combine tech and robotics. You can learn more about my work on <a href="/en/projects" >my projects page</a>, which presents a more general overview for all audiences.</p>
<p>Thanks to my varied background, I can work on both societal projects and traditional technical challenges with the same level of dedication and care. <a href="/en/contact" >Feel free to reach out</a> if you need a developer, whether for web development, data projects, or algorithm design.</p>
