    <p>By education, I&rsquo;m engineer in image and signal processing and PhD in robotics.
I then worked as a research engineer and IT project manager in multiple labs and in a start-up cooperative.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a free software developer because I believe this model to be way more ethical than proprietary softwares.
I believe most english readers will be fellow developers so I won&rsquo;t spend much time on it but it is, as you probably know, way more difficult to make a living by creating free softwares than by creating proprietary ones.</p>
<p>You can find an overview of my various computer projects on <a href="/en/projects" >the dedicated page</a>, as well as a more professional presentation of my background and skills on <a href="/en/cv/" >this page</a>.</p>
<p>Please feel free to <a href="/en/contact" >get in touch with me</a> if my profile piques your interest. We can explore potential collaborations, whether they be professional or not. I&rsquo;m constantly on the lookout for projects dedicated to improve social justice and I dedicate some of my free time to development work. So, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out if you&rsquo;re a low-budget organization in need of a developer!</p>
<p>Outside of work, I have the pleasure to serve as the president of the <a href="https://association-eclat38.fr/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">association ECLAT</a> where I coordinate a team of three professionals and around twenty volunteers to enhance the care provided to individuals who are in situation of exile and present post-traumatic stress syndromes.</p>
<p>I spend the rest of my time reading, tackling logical programming problems, or venturing into the mountains off the beaten paths&hellip;</p>
